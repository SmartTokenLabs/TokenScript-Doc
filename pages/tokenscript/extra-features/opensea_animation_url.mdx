# How to add TokenScript viewer to display token info in OpenSea

The OpenSea metadata standard includes the animation_url property.
animation_url supports HTML pages, allowing you to build rich experiences and interactive NFTs using JavaScript canvas, WebGL, and more.
The TokenScript viewer surfaces a special view that allows you to embed the TokenScript token card of your TokenScript in OpenSea and other platforms that supports HTML animation_url.

## Prerequisites

To support this functionality you must have these basic requirements met:

1. A TokenScript with the token information card (i.e. a card with type="token" attribute)
2. Access to set or update the animation URL for each token in your collection.

## Creating the tokenscript

The best way to develop & test your TokenScript is by using the TokenScript CLI.

1. Install the CLI `npm i -g @tokenscript/cli`
2. Initialise a TokenScript project by running the create command `tokenscript create %{YOUR_PROJECT_DIRECTORY}`
3. You will be asked to select a template. It is recommended to use the svelte or typescript template as it will allow
   you to utilise any NPM library in your code (i.e. to use ethers.js or other libraries to query blockchain data).
4. Next your will be asked to fill in some details for the template. Name, chain and contract are required, but
   you can leave the rest of the answers blank and can always update them later.
5. Once the command completes your TokenScript project will be located at the directory you specified.
   Change to the directory and run `tokenscript emulate`. This command will build the TokenScript project and serve it in your
   web browser. If all goes well, you should see your token in the SmartToken viewer. Clicking on the "Info" button in the token action list will
   display the card that will be shown in OpenSea using the animation URL.
6. You can preview the OpenSea view using the following URL:
   http://localhost:8090/?viewType=opensea&chain=137&contract=0xD5cA946AC1c1F24Eb26dae9e1A53ba6a02bd97Fe&tokenId=3803829543&tokenscriptUrl=http://localhost:8090/tokenscript.tsml
   (Replace the contract, chain and token ID with your own values that you entered in step)

### Customising the token card

Token cards contain normal HTML/JS/CSS that you can customise according to your needs. To do this simply edit the corresponding file/s for your
chosen template. These are:

- Svelte: src/routes/Info.svelte
- Typescript: src/templates/index.html & src/index.js
- Empty: index.html

The emulator can be used to live-reload your changes as you code.

## Premade templates

If you don't have the expertise to design your own TokenScript, SmartTokenLabs has developed some pre-made TokenScripts that you can use.

The Smart Token Store will soon have an online wizard that you can use to deploy these templates without writing a single line of code

## Deployment

### Upload your TokenScript to a public URL

Once you have completed your TokenScript design and development you must build your TokenScript and upload it to a publicly
accessible URL. This can be a web server, an Amazon S3 bucket (or other CDN) or even IPFS.
