# What is a Smart Token

A "Smart Token" is a blockchain-based digital asset that incorporates programmable logic, enabling it to function as a web service and an integration point for web applications. Unlike traditional tokens, which primarily symbolise a unit of value, Smart Tokens can represent a broad spectrum of assets or rights and interact with various web services. Within the Web ecosystem, Smart Token acts as a decentralised trust anchor, addressing the centralisation issues associated with conventional trust anchors. Trust in a Smart Token is derived from its embedded smart contract rules and the reputation of its issuer. It operates in a secure, separate runtime environment from the applications it supports, ensuring robust security and trustworthiness.
