# Card SDK

The Card SDK provides the glue between the Javascript defined in the TokenScript project and the engine.
It is essentially a 2-way message bus that allows the TokenScript developer to make requests to the engine and to receive updated data.
It also allows the user to access various data including context data, environment variables & contract information.
